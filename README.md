# Deep-Learning-for-Images-with-PyTorch
In this course, you'll use PyTorch to discover image classification, object recognition, segmentation, and image generation. You'll work with both binary and multi-class image classification models, utilize pre-trained models for deep learning tasks, and master object detection with bounding boxes.
